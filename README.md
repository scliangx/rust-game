# rust-game

  I was originally a server development engineer, but I am very interested in games and have been learning the Rust language recently. Therefore, I am trying to use Rust to write some small games to improve my Rust programming skills. My ultimate goal is to use Rust to create a card game, which is somewhat similar to `Peasants vs Landlord`. This is a card game in our local area, and there are many people playing it locally. I want to try using Rust to create it. This should be a very big challenge for me, and the process may be long because I have never done anything related to games before. I hope to persevere, and if it is ultimately completed, then it should be a very interesting thing.
